- 👋 Hi, I’m @LILITHRNMAMA
- 👀 I’m interested in music & trying to save my sanity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that murder really isn't worth a staycation at the local asylum.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on; I wasn't prepared for a follow up question.
- 📫 How to reach me, good luck. I rarely communicate, but I try.
